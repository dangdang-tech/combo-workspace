 * Gates the app shell behind the unauthenticated redirect check.
 *
 * This component subscribes to `useSegments()` (which changes per navigation) so that the
 * redirect decision stays live, but it is the ONLY navigation-subscribing owner in the root
 * layout render path. When no redirect is needed it returns its `children` unchanged — because
 * the parent (`RootLayout`) never re-renders on navigation, the child element reference is stable
 * and React skips re-rendering the entire Stack subtree. This is what stops every navigation from
 * re-rendering all mounted SceneViews.
